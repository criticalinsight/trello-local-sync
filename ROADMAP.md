    - Command Palette (⌘+K) for instant actions.

- [ ] **Streamlined Onboarding**
    - Interactive walkthrough for first-time users.
    - Empty-state illustrations and quick-start templates.
    - Contextual help tooltips.

- [ ] **Agent Status Dashboard**
    - Real-time visual progress for running agents.
    - Collapsible worker task panel for coordinators.
    - Live token usage and execution time display.

- [ ] **Polished Interactions**
    - Micro-animations for drag-and-drop.
    - Snackbar notifications for background events.
    - Optimistic feedback on all actions (buttons, saves).
