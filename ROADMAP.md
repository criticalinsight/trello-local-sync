# Strategic Roadmap: Work (Local-First AI Engine)

## 1. Vision & Strategy
Our mission is to build the world's most responsive, reliable, and intelligent productivity engine. By combining **local-first architecture** with **agentic AI capabilities**, we provide a professional workspace that works offline, syncs instantly at the edge, and automates complex cognitive tasks.
